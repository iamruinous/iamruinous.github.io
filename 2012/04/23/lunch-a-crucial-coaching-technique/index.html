    <p><strong>Make time to go to lunch with the people you are serving.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned far more about the organization, the people I&#8217;m working with, and the challenges that lie ahead by going to lunch with someone almost every single day I&#8217;m on site.</p>

<p>I believe that lunch is one of the least respected and valued times in American culture. It is a critical time of day to step back and release from the focus of our daily work. It is an ideal opportunity to restore sustenance not merely to our bodies, but our minds as well. I&#8217;ve forged or solidified many relationships over a simple lunch. The more you can talk, laugh, cry, and share life with those around you, the more human you become, the more influence you will be permitted to have.</p>

<p><strong>Lunch is a powerfully simple tool to leave behind lasting change.</strong></p>

<p>P.S. This is doubly important for those who are in a consultant role. There are many barriers to overcome when you are from the outside, especially with those who do not understand what you are doing here. Lunch is that safe opportunity to share a meal to reveal yourself as the amazing person you are. (without making it inappropriate, formal, or just plain weird, like a dinner with someone unfamiliar can be)</p>
