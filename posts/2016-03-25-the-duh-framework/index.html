<h1 id="duh-framework---communicate-better-duh">DUH Framework - Communicate Better, duh.</h1>
<p>Version 1.0.0</p>
<p>I commit myself to using a simple, action-oriented, framework to better communicate with my team.</p>

<p>During the process of <em>doing work</em>, what I am doing will change, and I will repeat the cycle.</p>
<h2 id="declare-my-intent">Declare My Intent</h2>
<p>Variability in schedules is challenging for me and my team to understand the current state of work.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Every time I take on work, I will declare my intent to work on it for my team to see.</p>
<h2 id="update-regularly">Update Regularly</h2>
<p>Forgetting to communicate openly and frequently when working on a project I am passionate about can be dangerous. It is also difficult to remember to ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: I will update my team on my progress at least one per day, preferably more frequently.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-goal">Have A Goal</h2>
<p>It is easy to get sidetracked if the goal is unclear. It is also hard to get support from the rest of the team if they don't understand my goal. I have master plans in my head that only the people I have spoken with may (or may not) know about. I am also not allowing input and feedback to improve my ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Update the roadmap of the project with my desired end-state before starting the work. As part of <a href="#declare-my-intent">Declare My Intent</a>, I will re-state the goal to my team to remind myself why I am doing the work and where I want to end up.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
