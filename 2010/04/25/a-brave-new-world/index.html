Hello all faithful followers (yes, Mom, I&amp;#8217;m talking to you). Today is a new day, a new dawn, a fresh start, what have you. I have decided that I need to make a new commitment to blogging. I need to force myself to practice and dramatically improve my writing and communication skills. I had previously maintained a blog over at http://iamruinous."/>

    <p>No, not a [amazon ASIN=&#8221;0060850523&#8243;]dystopian novel about eugenics[/amazon], this is my re-attempt to commit to a blogging world.</p>

<p>Hello all faithful followers (yes, Mom, I&#8217;m talking to you). Today is a new day, a new dawn, a fresh start, what have you. I have decided that I need to make a new commitment to blogging. I need to force myself to practice and dramatically improve my writing and communication skills. I had previously maintained a blog over at <a href="http://iamruinous.com">http://iamruinous.com</a>, but blogged very infrequently and unprofessionally.</p>

<p>Times have changed. I have been stockpiling a lot of topics over the last couple of years as I have worked in and on my business (<a href="http://integrumtech.com">Integrum Technologies</a>), helped to create a revolutionary movement (<a href="http://gangplankhq.com">Gangplank</a>), continued to faithfully serve (<a href="http://santancc.com">SanTan Christian Center</a>), and have been experimenting with new technologies and dealing with human and technical challenges.</p>

<p>I am steeling my discipline to blog once per week on any one of the above topics. We&#8217;ll see how it goes&#8230;</p>

<p>Note: Considering it took me 2 weeks to even get this posted up, I&#8217;m not feeling very optimistic :-/</p>
