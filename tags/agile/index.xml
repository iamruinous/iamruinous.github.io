      <title>Twenty-Something Theses of Autonomy</title>

      <description>I believe in a radically different organization than what exists in the world today. In order to build the new economy (and thus a new world) our ideas of how an organization works must be challenged (&amp;#8220;You can&amp;#8217;t make an omelete [sic] without nuking the existing social order&amp;#8220;). A keystone of this &amp;#8220;new way&amp;#8221; is Autonomy. In order to get the best results, Freedom is essential. I have begun the process of capturing my theory in my &amp;#8220;Twenty-Something Theses of Autonomy.</description>

      <title>My Coaching / Facilitation Toolkit</title>

      <description>I was asked recently to document what&amp;#8217;s I use for my toolkit when I&amp;#8217;m at a client engagement. I&amp;#8217;ve experimented with many different options and materials over the last year and so I&amp;#8217;ll share with you what I&amp;#8217;m currently using.
Before I show you the list, I want to share my philosophy that your toolkit needs to be simple, yet flexible. You never know what might happen during the course of a meeting you are facilitating, therefore you need to be prepared for anything.</description>

      <title>Why I became a Certified ScrumMaster</title>

      <description>On November 22nd I officially became a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM). I went to my CSM training with Michael Vizdos. I was surprised at what I was able to learn, and the level of conversation was much higher than I had anticipated. To put things in context, we have been using Scrum at Integrum for over 4 years, we have had multiple other CSMs and a CSP on staff, so I figured that I&amp;#8217;d heard it all before.</description>
