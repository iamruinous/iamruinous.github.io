      <description>I was asked recently to document what&amp;#8217;s I use for my toolkit when I&amp;#8217;m at a client engagement. I&amp;#8217;ve experimented with many different options and materials over the last year and so I&amp;#8217;ll share with you what I&amp;#8217;m currently using.
Before I show you the list, I want to share my philosophy that your toolkit needs to be simple, yet flexible. You never know what might happen during the course of a meeting you are facilitating, therefore you need to be prepared for anything.</description>

      <description>Make time to go to lunch with the people you are serving.
I&amp;#8217;ve learned far more about the organization, the people I&amp;#8217;m working with, and the challenges that lie ahead by going to lunch with someone almost every single day I&amp;#8217;m on site.
I believe that lunch is one of the least respected and valued times in American culture. It is a critical time of day to step back and release from the focus of our daily work.</description>
