      Would anyone be opposed to &#8230; ?
Are you opposed to &#8230; ?
 Or my personal favorite
 As long as no one is opposed &#8230;
 I hear this question, under many different guises, throughout the day. I cringe every time I hear it, especially when it comes out of my own mouth. The question sets up a challenge: &#8220;Do you dare prevent me from &#8230; ?

      I was asked recently to document what&#8217;s I use for my toolkit when I&#8217;m at a client engagement. I&#8217;ve experimented with many different options and materials over the last year and so I&#8217;ll share with you what I&#8217;m currently using.
Before I show you the list, I want to share my philosophy that your toolkit needs to be simple, yet flexible. You never know what might happen during the course of a meeting you are facilitating, therefore you need to be prepared for anything.

      Make time to go to lunch with the people you are serving.
I&#8217;ve learned far more about the organization, the people I&#8217;m working with, and the challenges that lie ahead by going to lunch with someone almost every single day I&#8217;m on site.
I believe that lunch is one of the least respected and valued times in American culture. It is a critical time of day to step back and release from the focus of our daily work.

      Lately I have been doing a lot of work with organizations on Portfolio Management. I needed to create a fun game to give an introduction to the challenges of an Agile Portfolio without being overwhelming.
In April 2011, I attended the Agile Game Incubator at Agile 2011 and utilized the PLAID technique that Mike and Don taught us. This framework was extremely helpful for focusing me on my objectives and building a solid game.

      I have been reading the book [amazon ASIN=&#8221;038552904X&#8221;]Fierce Conversations[/amazon]. It has helped me to have a much more direct approach to difficult conversations, especially the ones that you really want to put off because they are so uncomfortable.
Recently at Integrum we have been undergoing a lot of deep, radical change, more about that in a later post. This has required me to have some very honest conversations with my entire team, much of it unpleasant.
