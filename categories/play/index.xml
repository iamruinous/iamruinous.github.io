      <description>No, not a [amazon ASIN=”0060850523″]dystopian novel about eugenics[/amazon], this is my re-attempt to commit to a blogging world.
Hello all faithful followers (yes, Mom, I’m talking to you). Today is a new day, a new dawn, a fresh start, what have you. I have decided that I need to make a new commitment to blogging. I need to force myself to practice and dramatically improve my writing and communication skills. I had previously maintained a blog over at http://iamruinous.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hello all faithful followers (yes, Mom, I’m talking to you). Today is a new day, a new dawn, a fresh start, what have you. I have decided that I need to make a new commitment to blogging. I need to force myself to practice and dramatically improve my writing and communication skills. I had previously maintained a blog over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://iamruinous.com&#34;&gt;http://iamruinous.com&lt;/a&gt;, but blogged very infrequently and unprofessionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times have changed. I have been stockpiling a lot of topics over the last couple of years as I have worked in and on my business (&lt;a href=&#34;http://integrumtech.com&#34;&gt;Integrum Technologies&lt;/a&gt;), helped to create a revolutionary movement (&lt;a href=&#34;http://gangplankhq.com&#34;&gt;Gangplank&lt;/a&gt;), continued to faithfully serve (&lt;a href=&#34;http://santancc.com&#34;&gt;SanTan Christian Center&lt;/a&gt;), and have been experimenting with new technologies and dealing with human and technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am steeling my discipline to blog once per week on any one of the above topics. We’ll see how it goes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Considering it took me 2 weeks to even get this posted up, I’m not feeling very optimistic :-/&lt;/p&gt;
