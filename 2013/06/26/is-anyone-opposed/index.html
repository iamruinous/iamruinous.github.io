<p>I hear this question, under many different guises, throughout the day. I cringe every time I hear it, <em>especially when it comes out of my own mouth</em>. The question sets up a challenge: &#8220;Do you dare prevent me from &#8230; ?&#8221; Sometimes people will take you up on the challenge. If you are in a position of authority, many times they will not.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-this-a-bad-thing">Why is this a bad thing?</h3>

<p>The challenge will trigger a fight or flight response, increasing stress levels, dramatically decreasing the ability to create the best idea.</p>

<p>When this challenge is issued, the desired response is silence. <strong>Silence is not agreement.</strong> Silence can be a seed of bitterness and resentment that will bear fruit later.</p>

<p>By setting up agreement through inaction, you have also accepted the full consequences of this decision. If things go wrong, and the inevitably do, don&#8217;t expect any support from &#8220;the unopposed.&#8221; Just because they weren&#8217;t opposed, doesn&#8217;t mean they support it.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>

<p>Break the cycle of opposition. When I hear the <em>Opposed Question</em>, I pause, and state that it is time to make a decision. Turn the question around to ask &#8220;Will you support &#8230; ?&#8221; and get a response from each individual regarding their support. You should not take action until support is unanimous, and the best ideas have been discovered.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-going-to-take-forever">This is going to take forever!</h3>

<p>Getting unanimous support for taking action is extremely difficult. Luckily, there is help readily available. I have found the <a title="Decider Protocol" href="http://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/decider/" target="_blank">Decider</a> from the <a href="http://liveingreatness.com/how-to-use-the-core-protocols/" target="_blank">Core Protocols</a> to be an extremely helpful way to make unanimous decisions (that are biased toward results) that support the best ideas. Try it with your team!</p>

<p>So as long as no one is opposed, I&#8217;m going to publish this now&#8230;</p>
